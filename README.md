# 📧Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

## Overview
Welcome to the **Spam Mail Detection** project! This is a machine learning-based solution that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model is built using popular libraries like **scikit-learn** and **NLTK**, and it can be easily run through the provided **Streamlit app**.

🚀 **Try it out online**: [Spam Mail Detection Streamlit App](https://spammaildetectiongit-mxe5dejn3khetsnrju5qg9.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- **🤖Machine Learning Model**: Trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam and ham) to predict email classification.
- **📝NLP Techniques**: Text processing, tokenization, and feature extraction to analyze email content.
- **🌐Streamlit App**: A simple, interactive web app to classify emails online. No need to install anything – just open the app and start classifying emails!
- **⚡Real-time Prediction**: Upload your email content, and get immediate feedback on whether it's spam or not.
